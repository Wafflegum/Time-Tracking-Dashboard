### What I learned

I'm really proud of learning grid! Before this, I found grid useless as I really like how flex works. Now I've learned that flex is more of a responsive display-type and grid will be more of a fixed or structured display-type.

I've learned for of and Object.entries, which I think will help me in the future! Although I don't think I can implement it on the spot, it's good that I have been introduced with it by ChatGPT. I've also learned how to fetch JSON data from external files, which was quite a headache to learn as it's really a different approach.
